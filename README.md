# ðŸ“– Cendejas's Portfolio

Create a portfolio that utilizes the nav functionality, to direct the user to its corresponding section

## Description
* Implement flex containers to have more flexibility with block design

* Use nav tool to direct user to his/her desired section

* Provide user with information like developer's name, a photo, links to sections about them, their work and how to contact them

* Developer's first application image should be larger in size than the rest

* Included a reset.css file to make sure that the default settings are the same regardless of what browser is being used

## Notes
* Honestly took me forever to figure out how to create the links so that they do not
display as long as they are; in turn I was able to replace the text entirely which made the website look a lot more clean

* I tried to incorporate classes and ID's as much as possible to practice the different programming styles

* One thing I would like to change is under the about me section; I am not sure how to space my listed items evenly vertically to fill the flex container

* I included the variable tool ":root" so that modifications would be easier to do to my code; however I think I went overboard and applied the variable across properties that I will not necessarily want to modify collectively
